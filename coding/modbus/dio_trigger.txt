#this is a testing report of dio trigger situation

#the psu V1 output range is from 4.47v(ccw max) to 5.78v (cw max) 

#use 1k ohm and 3.3k ohm as divider,5.25v as source, the voltage show is 1.16v which is smaller than before situation(around 1.2 v)

on the other hand, the di port led will not on at all
	comment:even ater we plug off the data+ and data- port, the led still not on at all. very strange, need further verification


#use 1k ohm and 2k ohm as divider,5.25v as source, the voltage show is 1.6v

	we switch the source power to be max(5.78v), the devider power will be 1.76v,the led will be slightly on, but when we use python modbus module to test, the trigger situation for the port is still false.

#apply 5.25v source directly to the dio port. led will on, the trigger situation in the software is on as well
	comment: dio port will fully work in 5.25v situation

#apply 5.25v voltage source, use 2k ohm and 2k ohm as voltage devider, the voltage output power is 2.23v,led is bright, but the port not registered

switch the voltage source to be 5.78v,the output power is 2.43v,di port will registered 

	comment:di port will not work in 2.23 situation, but will work in 2.43 situation

# by turning the vs from 5.25 slowly up, we detected the minimum register voltage for the di port will be around 2.33v

# by repeat, we detected under 2.33v, every port for this dio will be triggered.

# now we test the actually voltage viartion range for sensor(under 5.25v vs):

for sensor I:

1.19v(cover fully) to 2.80v to 0.07v (not cover)

for sensor II:

1.11v(cover fully) to 2.81v to 0.04v (not cover)

comment: for both sensor, in real application situation(without taking comparator into consideration), the output voltage will be below 2.33v which will not be triggered.

#final conclusion: 24v vs and voltage devider is needed, the recommended devide voltage shall be around 1.2v
