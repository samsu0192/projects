#some idea think out during the weekend

//redesign of unibeat
'''
DIO can work upon 5v
#remove power socket, psu?
#remove dio, since only 3 singal needed upon now?
#bind together psu and pi, screen support multiple pi?
#choose a smaller box?
#use 5v adapter?
'''

//
use voice instead alert will be better remind method

//
can try trigger use very cheap type of servo

//
advanced(in the future):
for emergency situation, servo must be able to turn by hand, but once turn by hand, monitor system will be triggered to capture something

//
PCB board side:
can print out the circuit to save time and money

//about digital box
# buy long rj45 F/M cut in middle can save some material
# use a big box for all 3 shelf, which means 4 rj45 ports, 1 power socket needed
