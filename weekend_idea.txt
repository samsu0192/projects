#some idea think out during the weekend

//
use voice instead alert will be better remind method

//
can try trigger use very cheap type of servo

//
advanced(in the future):
for emergency situation, servo must be able to turn by hand, but once turn by hand, monitor system will be triggered to capture something

//
PCB board side:
can print out the circuit to save time and money

//about digital box
# buy long rj45 F/M cut in middle can save some material
# use a big box for all 3 shelf, which means 4 rj45 ports, 1 power socket needed
